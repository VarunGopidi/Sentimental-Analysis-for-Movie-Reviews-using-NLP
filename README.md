# Sentimental Analysis for Movie Reviews

In this project we aim to use Sentiment Analysis on a set of movie reviews given by
reviewers and try to understand what their overall reaction to the movie was, i.e., if they liked
the movie or they hated it. We aim to utilize the relationships of the words in the review to
predict the overall polarity of the review.

To implement this, you can either use:
-> Google Colab(Env used in the project) 
-> You can download Python and Jupyter Notebook.
-> The dataset used for training and testing is also included in the repository. 
-> This is the base version. You can create a user interface and make it into a advanced version.
